### Note to professor:

Thanks for the semester, boss! I learned a good deal from the Class! I will have to do some independent learning to dive
more deeper into C++ but your class was extremely helpful! I also appreciate you introducing us to some data structures & algo
stuff (it will help for next semester xD)! Anywhos, I hope that you enjoy my rject and are at least slightly engaged with what
I made!
